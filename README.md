# Maple Mountain

**Maple Mountain** is a satirical management game prototype build as a personal learning project.

The game is set in a fictional fantasy world and focuses on **economics, research, regulation, and social systems**, framed through dark humor and absurd worldbuilding. The primary goal of the project is technical growth rather than commercial release.

## Project Goals

This project is used to:

- Refresh and modernize my React knowledge
- Practice Typescript
- Build clean, scalable UI
- Experiment with game-like state management and system design
- Potentially explore Next.js as a the project evolves

## Tech Stack

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **React Router**
- **styled-components**
- **Vite**

## Current Features

- Component-based layout architecture
- Styled-components with clear separation of UI and layout layers
- Client-side routing
- Modular navigation system

## Planned Features

- Resource and economy systems
- Research & development mechanics
- Event-driven gameplay (regulation, protests, espionage, etc.)
- Dynamic UI based on player decisions
- Expanded state management as complexity grows

## Project Status

This is an **early-stage prototype** under active development. The codebase and structure are expected to evolve as sytems are added

## Notes

This repository contains additional design and concept documents that are intentionally more experimental and expressive. These files are part of the creative process and are not representative of production intent.
